# MIJ Matlab-ImageJ connector

**A Java package for running ImageJ and Fiji within Matlab**

MIJ offers the missing link between two imaging software: ImageJ/Fiji and Matlab. The goal of the package mij.jar is to provide static methods to exchange images and volumes. MIJ allows also to access to all built-in functions of ImageJ and to third-part plugins of ImageJ. MIJ is integrated in Fiji with a super-easy script to use it.
Thanks to the Fiji team, MIJ is now super-easy to use using a Matlab script Miji.m which is integrated in Fiji. ImageJ/Fiji becomes a image-processing librairie of Matlab.
